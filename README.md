# Telco Customer Churn Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset from a telecommunications company, focusing on customer churn. The project aims to uncover insights into factors contributing to customer churn and identify trends and patterns within the data.

## Features
__Data Loading and Inspection:__ The notebook starts with loading the dataset using pandas and displays the first few rows for a preliminary inspection.</br>
__Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:__ Key steps in data cleaning and preprocessing are covered to ensure the data is suitable for analysis.</br
__Exploratory Data Analysis:__ In-depth EDA is performed using various statistical methods and visualizations to understand the data better and draw meaningful conclusions about customer churn.

## Libraries Used
* Pandas for data manipulation
* Numpy for numerical operations
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Dataset
